# Intro to Remix: Teaching young dogs old tricks

This is a demo of a simple app built with [Remix](https://remix.run), a web framework that builds on web standards. This demo was prepared for a [meetup talk](https://www.meetup.com/react-atx/events/frbdlryfcfbcc/) given on March 22nd, 2023.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

For more information on starting your own remix project, checkout [the docs](https://remix.run/docs/).

## Overview

There are a _lot_ of cool aspects to building Remix Applications, but for the sake of time and focus, I'm going to highlight what to me are the best parts.

1. SSR
2. Nested Layouts
3. Data loading
4. Sesssion Management ðŸ‘ˆ YOU ARE HERE
5. Mutations

## Who am I?

My name is [Brooks Lybrand](https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand) and I am a Senior Web Engineer for the best grocery store in the world (okay, at least in Texas), [H-E-B](https://heb.com)!

I specialize in building proof of concepts, evaluating tools, and creating highly interactive, data-rich applications. I enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies to help create better experiences for both developers and end-users.

When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my wife and dogs, camping, playing board games, and pretending I know what I'm talking about when it comes to coffee and mixed drinks.
